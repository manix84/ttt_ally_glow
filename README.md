# [TTT] Ally Glow
![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manix84/ttt_ally_glow/master/images/icon/ttt_ally_glow_128x.jpg)

Give your allies a glowing halo.

Designed to work with [Custom Roles for TTT](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2045444087). That means the logic as to who can see who's halo is based on that.

## Features:

- __Traitor Team__ (Traitors, Hypnotists, and Assassins) see:
    - Traitors, Hypnotists, and Assassins glow Red
    - Glitches glow Red (pretending to be a Traitor)
    - Jesters and Swappers glow Pink (optional)
- __Monster Team__ (Zombies, and Vampires) see:
    - Zombies and Vampires glow Green
    - Glitches glow Green (pretending to be a Zombie)
    - Jesters and Swappers glow Pink (optional)
- __Innocent Team__ (Innocent, Glitch, Mercenary, and Phantom) see:
    - Nothing
- __Innocent Team__ (Detective) see:
    - Detectives glow Blue to other Detectives

If you want to enable Jester Glow, you can do so by adding `ttt_jester_glow 1` to your server.cfg
